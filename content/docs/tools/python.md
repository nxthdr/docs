### Probes Generation

[Prowl](https://github.com/nxthdr/prowl) is a Python library designed to simplify the process of generating probes for the **nxthdr** platform. It implements common tools and algorithms such as [tokio-ping](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2013/papers/imc125s-pelsserA.pdf) and [yarrp](https://www.cmand.org/papers/yarrp-imc16.pdf).
