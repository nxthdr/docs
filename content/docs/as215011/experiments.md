**nxthdr** and **AS215011** provide a platform for conducting Internet measurement experiments, with a particular focus on routing and peering dynamics.

Because we operate our own Autonomous System and maintain multiple peering points, we are able to control prefix announcements and influence routing behavior during experiments. This enables researchers to test hypotheses related to BGP routing, peering relationships, path selection, geolocation, and the effects of different configurations on measurement results.

At this time, we do not yet offer a self-service interface for peering experiments, but this feature is on our roadmap. In the meantime, if you're interested in running an experiment or collaborating, please [contact us](/docs/reference/contact).
