When using **nxthdr** data in your research or presentations, please follow these guidelines to promote data integrity, transparency, and reproducibility.

### Specify Datasets Clearly

Indicate exactly which datasets you used, including any custom datasets you created. Be sure to mention the data collection period, as well as any processing or enrichment steps you applied.

### Acknowledge Limitations

Describe any constraints, limitations, or potential biases in the measurement data. If you encounter issues or limitations with the platform, we encourage you to [contact us](/docs/reference/contact). Your feedback helps us improve the platform for everyone.

### Share Your Research Artifacts

Whenever possible, share your code, scripts, and analysis notebooks to enable others to reproduce your results. For example:

* Use [Marimo](https://marimo.io) to create interactive notebooks that can be viewed and executed by others.
* Use [Datasette](https://datasette.io) to publish your datasets in an easily accessible, queryable format.
