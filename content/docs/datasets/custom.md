We can help you create custom datasets tailored to your research or analysis needs. If you have specific requirements or ideas for datasets that are not currently available on **nxthdr**, feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KRsVs7jafg) or by [email](mailto:admin@nxthdr.dev).

Since **nxthdr** is an open platform, we ask that you share your dataset with the community as soon as youâ€™re comfortable, so others can benefit from it and reproduce your results. One way to share datasets is through [Datasette](https://datasette.io/), which makes it easy to publish data in a format that can be queried and explored by others. Please note that all data collected by **nxthdr** is placed in the public domain, and any custom datasets must also be released under the same terms.
