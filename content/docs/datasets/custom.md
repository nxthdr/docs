We can help you create custom datasets tailored to your research or analysis needs. If you have specific requirements or ideas for datasets that are not currently available on nxthdr, feel free to [reach out](/docs/reference/contact).

Since nxthdr is an open platform, we ask that you share your dataset with the community as soon as you’re comfortable, so others can benefit from it and reproduce your results. One way to share datasets is through [Datasette](https://datasette.io/), which makes it easy to publish data in a format that can be queried and explored by others. Please note that all data collected by nxthdr is placed in the public domain ([PDDL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/)), and any custom datasets must also be released under the same terms.
