**PeerLab** is the nxthdr peering platform that enables researchers, students, and network operators to conduct real-world BGP and routing experiments using production Internet infrastructure.

## Platform Status

PeerLab is currently **experimental**. Core functionality is operational, but we are refining the user experience and documentation.

**Experimental Exit Criteria**

Achieve a complete documentation for the user experience that covers all features and workflows, from the lease process to advanced routing configurations and BGP data feedback usage.

If you are interested in being an early adopter of PeerLab, please [sign up](https://nxthdr.dev) and access the [peering dashboard](https://nxthdr.dev/peering) to get started. Don't forget to give us your feedback and suggestions (see [contact](/docs/reference/contact/)).

## Applications

**BGP & Routing Experiments**

Conduct hands-on experiments with BGP policies, traffic engineering, and routing dynamics in production networks. Test routing policies, validate BGP security mechanisms, study AS path manipulation, and analyze community propagation.

**Education & Learning**

Teach networking courses with real Internet resources. Students can announce real prefixes and observe routing behavior on production networks, not simulations.

**Joint Peering & Probing Studies**

Combine [Saimiris](/docs/probing/) with PeerLab to conduct unique experiments. Study how routing changes affect reachability, latency, and path selection in real-time.

**Reproducible Research**

Validate and reproduce prior studies with access to consistent infrastructure and open datasets. All routing data is made freely available through our public [datasets](/docs/datasets/).

## Features

**Lease Public IPv6 Prefixes**

Request IPv6 prefixes from our allocation and announce them to the real Internet through our network. Control your announcements and withdrawals to study routing dynamics and path selection in production networks.

**Announce from Multiple IXPs**

Announce your leased prefixes from multiple Internet Exchange Points across Europe. Observe how your routing decisions propagate globally and affect traffic patterns.

**Monitor Your Announcements**

All routing data from AS215011 is passively collected and made freely available. Monitor your own announcements, analyze routing behavior, and study BGP dynamics using our public [datasets](/docs/datasets/).

## Network Infrastructure

We operate [AS215011](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/36080), an IPv6-only research-focused Autonomous System designed specifically for routing experiments and active measurements.

Learn more about our [network infrastructure](/docs/peering/infrastructure/) including IXP locations, routing policy, and how to peer with us as another network.
