[nxthdr](https://nxthdr.dev) operates a global network infrastructure designed specifically for Internet research and education. Our platform offers flexible worldwide active measurements from our own autonomous system and peering capabilities through multiple Internet exchanges.

All datasets are shared in the public domain, every tool and systems are open source, and the entire infrastructure is designed rapid experimentation and reproducibility.

If you find something missing in the documentation, please open an  [issue](https://github.com/nxthdr/docs/issues) or mention it on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KRsVs7jafg).
