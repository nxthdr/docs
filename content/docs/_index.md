[nxthdr](https://nxthdr.dev) operates a global network infrastructure designed specifically for Internet research and education. Our platform offers flexible worldwide active measurements from our own autonomous system and peering capabilities through multiple Internet exchanges.

All datasets are shared in the public domain, every tool and systems are open source, and the entire infrastructure is designed rapid experimentation and reproducibility.

If you find something missing in the documentation, please open an  [issue](https://github.com/nxthdr/docs/issues) or [contact us](/docs/reference/contact).

## Applications

**BGP & Routing Experiments**

Peer with our IXP servers, lease public IPv6 prefixes, and announce them to the real Internet. Conduct hands-on experiments with BGP policies, traffic engineering, and routing dynamics in production networks.

**Internet Topology & Performance Research**

Perform active measurements from multiple global locations and analyze BGP dynamics, CDN behavior, routing patterns, and global connectivity using comprehensive real-world data collected with Saimiris.

**Joint Peering & Probing Studies**

Combine active measurements with your own announced prefixes to conduct unique experiments impossible on other platforms. Study how routing changes affect reachability, latency, and path selection in real-time.

**Measurement Tooling & Algorithm Development**

Build, test, and benchmark innovative measurement techniques and algorithms leveraging our global high-speed infrastructure with full control over source addressing.

**Education & Learning**

Teach networking courses with real Internet resources. Students can peer with actual IXPs, announce real prefixes, and perform measurements on production networks.

**Reproducible Research**

Validate and reproduce prior studies with access to consistent, open datasets and standardized measurement infrastructure across both passive BGP monitoring and active probing.
