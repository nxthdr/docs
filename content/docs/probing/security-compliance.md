When using Saimiris, you must conduct measurements responsibly and ethically. For complete details on requirements and prohibited activities, see our [terms of service](/docs/reference/terms/).

Key requirements include:

* No denial of service attacks or flooding
* No network intrusion or unauthorized security testing
* No espionage or surveillance activities
* Respect for target networks and abuse complaints
* Compliance with applicable laws and regulations

## Monitoring

We implement comprehensive monitoring to ensure responsible use of the Saimiris measurement platform:

**Current Monitoring**

* All probes sent through the platform are logged and monitored
* Measurement results are publicly available and auditable by anyone

**Future Enhancements**

* Per user probe statistics to track usage patterns and detect anomalies
* Target blocklist filtering to prevent probes from reaching blocked destinations, regardless of TTL value

This monitoring framework helps us identify and prevent abuse while maintaining transparency in our measurement operations.
