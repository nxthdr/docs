We take privacy seriously and aim to minimize the amount of personal data we collect and store. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us at [admin@nxthdr.dev](mailto:admin@nxthdr.dev).

### Data Controller

The data controller is currently the individual maintaining the **nxthdr** platform. In the future, this responsibility may be transferred to a registered non-profit organization, which will be clearly communicated when in place.

### Authentication and Account Data

We use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as our identity provider for user authentication and authorization. Auth0 servers used are based in the European Union and complies with the GDPR.

When you log into **nxthdr**, Auth0 handles your account information (e.g. email, password) directly. We do **not** store or access your email, password, or any personally identifiable information.

### What We Store

In our infrastructure, we store only a hashed version of the client ID assigned to you by Auth0. This hashed ID is used internally to:

* Track measurement activity (e.g. probes sent, experiments conducted)
* Manage credit usage and enforce platform limits

This identifier is not linked to any personal information such as your name or email on our servers.

### Cookies

Auth0 may use cookies to manage authentication sessions. **nxthdr** itself does not use cookies for tracking or profiling purposes.

### Data Access, Correction, and Deletion

You have the right to:

* Request access to the data associated with your account (i.e., your hashed client ID and usage history)
* Request correction or deletion of your data at any time

To do so, please contact us at [admin@nxthdr.dev](mailto:admin@nxthdr.dev).

### Data Retention

We retain usage-related data (e.g. measurements, credits) for as long as your account is active, or until you request deletion.

### Lawful Basis for Processing

We process your data under the lawful basis of **legitimate interests**, in order to provide you with access to the platform’s features, ensure fair use, and enable reproducible research. This is in line with Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR.

### No Third-Party Sharing

We do not share your data with third parties, and we do not use your data for advertising or marketing purposes.
